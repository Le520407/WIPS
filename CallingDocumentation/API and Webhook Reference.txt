“ENABLED”

sip

JSON object

Optional

Configure call signaling via signal initiation protocol (SIP).

Note: When SIP is enabled, you cannot use calling related endpoints and will not receive calling related webhooks.

Learn how to configure and use SIP call signaling

"sip": {
   "status": "ENABLED | DISABLED (default)",
   "servers": [// one server per app]
     {
       "hostname": SIP_SERVER_HOSTNAME
       "port": SIP_SERVER_PORT,
       "request_uri_user_params": {
         "KEY1": "VALUE1", // for cases like TGRP
         "KEY2": "VALUE2",
       }
     }
   ]
 }
Parameter details: Calling status
When the status parameter is set to “ENABLED”, calling features are enabled for the business phone number. WhatsApp client applications will render the call button icon in both the business chat and business chat profile.

When the status parameter is set to “DISABLED”, calling features are disabled, and both the business chat and business chat profile do not display the call button icon.

Updates to status will update the call button icon in existing business chats in near real-time when the business phone number is in the WhatsApp user's contacts.

Otherwise, updates are real-time for a limited number of users in conversation with the business, and are eventual for the rest of conversations.

Parameter details: Call button icon visibility
When Calling API features are enabled for a business number, you can still choose whether to show the call button icon or not by using the call_icon_visibility parameter. Note: Disabling call button icon visibility does not disable a WhatsApp user’s ability to make unsolicited calls to your business.

The behavior for supported options is as follows:

DEFAULT

The Call button icon will be displayed in the chat menu bar and the business info page, allowing for unsolicited calls to the business by WhatsApp users.



DISABLE ALL

The call button icon is hidden in the chat menu bar and the business info page, and all other entry points external to the chat are also disabled. Consumers cannot make unsolicited calls to the business.

Your business can still send interactive messages or template messages with a Calling API CTA button.



Callback permissions
Calling a WhatsApp user requires explicit permission from the user. One way to obtain calling permissions is to request permission when a WhatsApp user calls your business.

You can configure the call permission UI to automatically show in the WhatsApp user’s client app when they call your business number. The user may change their permission selection at any time.



Call hours
With the call_hours setting, you can specify the timezone, business operating hours, and holiday schedules that will be enforced for all user-initiated calls.

Configuring this setting restricts calls only to available weekly hours you configure. User-initiated calls are unavailable outside of the weekly hours and holiday schedules you set.

The WhatsApp client app will show users an option to chat with the business, or request a callback, if callback_permission_status is ENABLED. The user will also be shown the next available calling slot on the option screen.

Pre-accept call
In essence, when you pre-accept an inbound call, you are allowing the calling media connection to be established before attempting to send call media through the connection.

When you then call the accept call endpoint, media begins flowing immediately since the connection has already been established

Pre-accepting calls is recommended because it facilitates faster connection times and avoids audio clipping issues.

There is about 30 to 60 seconds after the Call Connect webhook is sent for the business to accept the phone call. If the business does not respond, the call is terminated on the WhatsApp user side with a "Not Answered" notification and a Terminate Webhook is delivered back to you.

Note: Since the WebRTC connection is established before calling the Accept Call endpoint, make sure to flow the call media only after you receive a 200 OK response back.

If call media flows too early, the caller will miss the first few words of the call. If call media flows too late, callers will hear silence.

Response parameters
Parameter	Description
permission

JSON Object

The permission object contains two values:

status (String) — The current status of the permission.

Can be either:

“no_permission”
"temporary"
expiration (Integer) — The Unix time at which the permission will expire in UTC timezone.

actions

JSON Object

A list of actions a business phone number may undertake to facilitate a call permission or a business initiated call.

Current actions are:

send_call_permission_request: Represents the action of sending new call permissions request messages to the WhatsApp user.

start_call: Represents the action of establishing a new call with the WhatsApp user. Establishing a new call means that the call was successfully picked up by the consumer.

For example, send_call_permission_request having a can_perform_action of true means that your business can send a call permission request to the WhatsApp user in question

can_perform_action (Boolean) —

A flag indicating whether the action can be performed now, taking into account all limits.

limits

JSON Object

A list of time-bound restrictions for the given action_name.

Each action_name has 1 or more restrictions depending on the timeframe.

For example, a business can only send 2 permission requests in a 24-hour period.

limits contains the following fields:

time_period (String) — The span of time in which the limit applies, represented in the ISO 8601 format.

max_allowed (Integer) — The maximum number of actions allowed within the specified time period.

current_usage (Integer) — The current number of actions the business has taken within the specified time period.

limit_expiration_time (Integer) — The Unix time at which the limit will expire in UTC timezone.

If current_usage is under the max allowed for the limit, this field won’t be present.

Error response
Possible errors that can occur:

Invalid phone-number-id
If the consumer phone number is uncallable, the api response will be no_permission.
Permissions/Authorization errors.
Rate limit reached. A maximum of 5 requests in a 1 second window can be made to the API.
Calling is not enabled for the business phone number.

Calling API Webhooks
Call Connect webhook
A webhook notification is sent in near real-time when a call initiated by your business is ready to be connected to the whatsapp user (an SDP Answer).

Critically, the webhook contains information required to establish a call connection via WebRTC.

Once you receive the Call Connect webhook, you can apply the SDP Answer received in the webhook to your WebRTC stack in order to initiate the media connection.

SDP Overview and Sample SDP Structures
Session Description Protocol (SDP) is a text-based format used to describe the characteristics of multimedia sessions, such as voice and video calls, in real-time communication applications. SDP provides a standardized way to convey information about the session's media streams, including the type of media, codecs, protocols, and other parameters necessary for establishing and managing the session.

In the context of WebRTC, SDP is used to negotiate the media parameters between the sender and receiver, enabling them to agree on the specifics of the media exchange.
