Groups API FAQ
What happens when I delete a group?
No members, including you, will be able to message the group.

Some possible reasons include:

The invite link may have been deleted.
You may have removed the participant from the group previously.
The group may already be full.
How can I send my invite link to users?
You can send the invite link over a 1:1 conversation.
A new utility template is available in the Template Library to send group invite links.
You may also create custom, free-form marketing templates.
