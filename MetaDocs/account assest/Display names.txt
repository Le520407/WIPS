You must provide a display name when registering a business phone number. The display name appears in your business phone number’s WhatsApp profile:

It can also appear at the top of individual chat threads and the chat list if your business phone number is approved via display name verification. Note that if a WhatsApp user edits your profile name in the WhatsApp client, the name they set will appear instead.
Display name guidelines
See our Display name guidelines for the WhatsApp Business Platform Help Center article for naming guidelines.
Display name verification
When you reach a higher messaging limit, your business phone number’s display name will automatically undergo verification based on our display name guidelines. When we complete the process, a phone_number_name_update webhook and Meta Business Suite notification will be triggered.
If your display name is approved, the webhook will have decision set to APPROVED, and we will set the name_status field on your business phone number to APPROVED.
If your display name is rejected, the webhook will have decision set to REJECTED, and we will set the name_status field on your business phone number to DECLINED. If your name is rejected, we recommend that you re-review our display name guidelines and edit your display name accordingly, or file an appeal via Developer Support or Enterprise Developer Support.
Viewing display name in WhatsApp Manager
Your business phone number’s display name appears in the Name column in the WhatsApp Manager > Account tools > Phone numbers panel.
Getting display name and display name status via API
Request the verified_name and name_status field on your WhatsApp Business Phone Number ID to get its display name and display name status. See the GET /<WHATSAPP_BUSINESS_PHONE_NUMBER_ID> reference for a list of returnable values and their meanings.
Note that the verified_name value does not indicate if the display name is approved or not, it just represents the display name string that will undergo verification when eligible. The name_status field indicates its approval status.

Updating display name via API
Use the POST /<WHATSAPP_BUSINESS_PHONE_NUMBER_ID> endpoint’s new_display_name field to update your display name via API.

Upon success, your display name will undergo display name verification. If you want to check the verification status, request the new_display_name and new_name_status fields on your business phone number ID:
Example request
curl 'https://graph.facebook.com/v23.0/106540352242922?fields=new_display_name,new_name_status' \

If your newly updated display name is approved, your business phone number’s verified_name and name_status fields will be updated to reflect your new display name and name status, and phone_number_name_update webhooks will be triggered.
