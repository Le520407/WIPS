WhatsApp is launching usernames later in 2026.
Usernames are an optional feature for users and businesses. If a username is adopted by a WhatsApp user, their username will be displayed instead of their phone number in the app. Business usernames are not intended for privacy, however. If you adopt a business username, it will not cause your business phone number to be hidden in the app.
To support usernames, we will share a new backend user identifier called business-scoped user ID, or BSUID. BSUID uniquely identifies a WA user and is tied to a specific business.
This document describes how the addition of usernames will impact API requests, API responses, and webhook payloads. Additional changes to support usernames before the feature is made available will be recorded here.
Any changes described in this document are subject to change.
User usernames
A user username is a unique, optional name that WhatsApp users can set in order to display their username instead of their phone number in the app. Usernames can be used in lieu of profile names when personalizing message content for individual users.
WhatsApp users are limited to 1 username, but are able to change them periodically. Changing a username does not affect the user’s phone number or business-scoped user ID, and does not affect the user’s ability to communicate with other WhatsApp users or businesses on the WhatsApp Business Platform.
Usernames are assigned to the username property in API responses and webhooks payloads. Once enabled, a WhatsApp user’s username will appear in all incoming messages webhooks, and all delivered and read status messages webhooks.
Business-scoped user ID
A business-scoped user ID (“BSUID”) is a unique user identifier that can be used to message a WhatsApp user when you don’t know their phone number. BSUID will be assigned to the user_id parameter and appear in all messages webhooks, regardless of whether or not the user has enabled the username feature.
BSUIDs will be:
generated automatically
composed of up to 256 alphanumeric characters
unique to each business portfolio-user pair (business portfolios were formerly known as Business Managers)
regenerated if a user changes their phone number (which trigger a system status messages webhook)
BSUIDs can be used to send any type of message except for one-tap, zero-tap, and copy code authentication templates, which require user phone numbers.
Note that since BSUIDs are unique to each business portfolio-user pair, if you have multiple portfolios, your API requests will fail if you are attempting to message a BSUID that is scoped to a different portfolio. However, there may be legitimate use cases for some businesses to share the BSUID between business portfolios. We are scoping a solution to simplify this process. Please note to your Meta POC if you would like to discuss.
Phone numbers
When a user adopts a username, their phone number will not be included in messages webhooks in some cases. Instead, their BSUID will be sent in a new user_id field, and their phone number may be sent as an empty string in the wa_id field, on both existing and new API versions. Although phone numbers will still be shared in a few cases, primarily for existing customer interactions, it is essential for you to begin ingesting BSUIDs as soon as possible, to minimize losing any conversation context.
If you message/call a WhatsApp user’s phone number, or receive a message/call from their phone number, we will include their phone number in API responses and messages webhooks for 30 days from the time of sending or receiving, regardless of whether or not the user has adopted a username. Sending/calling or receiving a message/call to or from the user’s phone number within this window will reset the 30 day window.
There may be situations where you receive messages from existing customers outside of the 30 day window that look like a message from a new user, because their phone number is not in the messages webhook (wa_id is an empty string). To ensure you can identify username adopters and maintain conversation context beyond 30 days, we are building a feature that will allow you to continue to receive a user’s phone number even after they have adopted a username, provided you have messaged the user’s phone number in the past. Communication history will be recorded starting from feature opt-in. We will provide details on the opt-in process and timing as they become available.
If a user has not adopted a username, messages webhooks will include both their phone number and their BSUID.
You can message users using either their BSUID or phone number as soon as BSUIDs begin appearing in API responses and webhook payloads.
Country codes
When a WhatsApp user enables the username feature, their phone number may not appear in webhooks. If you don’t know their phone number but still need to communicate with them, you can send a message to their BSUID.
Country code will be included in all messages webhooks (subject to change).
Business usernames
Businesses will also be able to adopt a business username. If you adopt a business username, however, it will not cause your business phone number to be hidden in the WhatsApp or WhatsApp Business client.
A business username is mapped to a single business phone number across all of WhatsApp, i.e. a phone number can have only one username at a given time, and no two WhatsApp phone numbers (consumer or business) can have the same username.
Business usernames must adhere to the following format:
may only contain english letters (a-z), digits (0-9), period (.) and underscore (_) characters
must be between 3-35 characters in length
must contain at least one English letter (a-z, A-Z)
must not start or end with a period or have 2 consecutive periods
must not start with www
must not end with a domain (e.g., .com, .org, .net, .int, .edu, .gov, .mil, .us, .in, .html, etc.)
case is ignored when comparing usernames, but period and underscore characters are not; for example, myID and myid are the same *username but myid, my.id and my_id are all distinct
Reserved usernames
Before the username feature is made available, you will have the option to claim a username that WhatsApp has reserved for you. Alternatively, you can adopt a different username that aligns with your branding requirements. A reserved username can be claimed through WhatsApp Manager, Meta Business Suite, or via API. Claimed usernames that are approved will become active once the username feature is made available.
If your reserved username is already in use with your Facebook Page or Instagram account, you must link your business phone number to your Facebook Page or Instagram account before you will be able to claim the username. To link your page or account, you must have full control of the page or account, or basic partial access with the manage_phone permission.
See About business portfolio and business asset permissions for information about control/access and permissions.
Chat window display priority
The following priority will be followed (in decreasing order of priority) for displaying business profile information in chat windows in the app. Your business phone numbers will always appear in your business profile.
Saved contact name
Verified business name or Official Business Account name
Username
Phone number

FAQs
What do I need to do to support usernames?
BSUIDs and country code (subject to change) will begin appearing in webhooks payloads before usernames are made available to WhatsApp users. You will need to adopt BSUIDs in order to process user-initiated messages from users who have adopted a username. To do this, you must:
Update your webhook integrations to support BSUIDs, which will be assigned to a new user_id property in existing webhooks.
Build logic to support handling multiple identifiers (phone numbers from non-username adopters; BSUIDs from username adopters if phone number is not present in webhooks), and map relevant fields back to your CRM/database.
Update internal and external systems related to these integrations to be able to handle BSUIDs and join with previous identifiers; primarily CRM (either 3P or internal database) and any tools or workflows triggered off of CRM (e.g., triggered campaign messages, campaign management, measurement, billing, etc.).
If you still require customer phone numbers, update your messaging bots/journeys (if used) to request phone numbers, handle scenarios where users do not share phone numbers, and iterate on these new conversation journeys.
If you have multiple business portfolios with Meta, you may want to implement a solution to enable central CRM access across multiple portfolios, to minimize the operational overhead that comes with using and storing BSUIDs.
When will I receive a BSUID vs. a phone number?
When a user adopts a username, they will have phone number privacy meaning their phone number will not be displayed in the app, and their phone number will not be included in webhooks. If the user’s phone number is not present (the wa_id property is set to an empty string), you can use their BSUID, which will be included and assigned to a new user_id property.
If a user has not adopted usernames, you will receive both their phone number and their BSUID.
We will continue to share the phone number in a few cases, primarily for existing customer interactions. We’ll automatically include or return the user’s phone number on a rolling 30 days after any interaction between you and the user’s phone number, or if your business phone number is in the user’s WhatsApp contacts list.
Per our Cloud API Terms of Service, however, phone numbers and related data are retained for a maximum of 30 days to support features like message redelivery. There may be situations where you receive messages from existing users outside of this 30 day window, which may look like a new user thread to you. Therefore, it is essential that you begin supporting BSUIDs as soon as possible, to minimize losing any conversation context.
Why do partners and directly-integrated businesses using the Cloud API, including directly integrated ads that click to WhatsApp advertisers, have to adopt BSUID?
Partners and businesses must adopt BSUID to continue processing incoming messages from WhatsApp username adopters. Once BSUID is adopted and user messages from username adopters are processed, message webhooks will no longer include phone numbers in some cases as part of the webhook such as wa_id, so partners and businesses must ensure all connected systems can handle BSUID. They will also be able to ask for a user’s phone number in-thread.
If a business has not yet adopted BSUID and starts to receive messages from username adopters which they cannot process, will there be any recourse or corrective action?
If a business has not yet adopted BSUID and is not able to process messages from username adopters, there will not be any recourse or corrective action.
For messages from new customers of the business: Meta will continue to send the webhook of an incoming message. Depending on the specifics of the implementation, this may impact systems that are not equipped to handle an empty string being sent in the wa_id field when phone number is not present, and BSUID being sent through a new field.
For messages from existing customers of the business: we will continue to share the phone number in a few cases, primarily for existing customer interactions.
How do business usernames differ from display names? When will a user see a business username vs a display name?
Business usernames will provide an ability for the users to reach the business by the business’ username, meaning an end user can search for a business username using their exact username and reach out to the businesses. Since end users cannot search by display names, business usernames offer a clear advantage as a searchable and unique identifier for users to reliably find the correct business.
Business usernames must follow specific formatting rules on length and allowed characters, while display names have some more leeway in terms of formatting.
Business usernames are unique and are tied 1-1 to phone numbers, meaning @JaspersMarket would be tied to one phone number while @JaspersMarketCustomerSupport would be tied to another phone number. Display names are not tied 1-1 to phone numbers, meaning the display name Jasper’s Market can have 10 phone numbers under this display name.
When a business has both a username and display name, display name will be shown first (e.g., in Profile, Chat list, Messages, etc), for the businesses to build trust with the users and for users to recognize the business when business reaches out to the user.
