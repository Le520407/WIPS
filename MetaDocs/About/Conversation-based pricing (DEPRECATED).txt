onversation-based pricing is deprecated. It was replaced on July 1, 2025, with per-message pricing. The document below is for reference purposes only.
This document explains how conversation-based pricing works on the WhatsApp Business Platform.
Charges are applied per conversation, not per individual message sent or received.
Conversations are 24-hour message threads between you and your customers. They are opened and charged when messages you send to customers are delivered. The criteria that determines when a conversation is opened and how it is categorized is explained below.
Businesses are responsible for reviewing the category assigned to their approved templates. Whenever a template is used, a business accepts the charges associated with the category applied to the template at time of use.
Conversation categories
Conversations are categorized with one of the following categories:
Marketing — Enables you to achieve a wide range of goals, from generating awareness to driving sales and retargeting customers. Examples include new product, service, or feature announcements, targeted promotions/offers, and cart abandonment reminders.
Utility — Enables you to follow-up on user actions or requests. Examples include opt-in confirmation, order/delivery management (e.g., delivery update); account updates or alerts (for example., payment reminder); or feedback surveys.
Authentication — Enables you authenticate users with one-time pass codes, potentially at multiple steps in the login process (e.g., account verification, account recovery, integrity challenges).
Service — Enables you to resolve customer inquiries.
Marketing, utility, and authentication conversations can only be opened with template messages. Service conversations can be opened with any type of message other than a template message.
See Message Types to learn more about the various types of messages you can send to customers.
Opening conversations
Conversations are opened when you send a message to a customer under the following conditions.
Marketing, Utility, and Authentication Conversations
When you send an approved marketing, utility, or authentication template to a customer, we check if an open conversation matching the template’s category already exists between you and the customer. If one exists, no new conversation is opened. If one does not exist, a new conversation of that category is opened, lasting 24 hours.
For example:
Hour 0: You send a targeted promotion (marketing template message) to a customer. No open marketing conversation exists between you and the customer, so a marketing conversation lasting 24 hours is opened.
Hour 4: The customer completes an order on your site, so you send them an order confirmation (utility template message). No open utility conversation exists between you and the customer, so a utility conversation lasting 24 hours is opened.
Hour 10: You send a shipment confirmation (utility template message) to the customer. An open utility conversation already exists between you and the customer, so a new utility conversation is not opened.
To learn more about template categories and how to choose an appropriate category when creating templates, see Template Categorization.
For additional examples, see our pricing explainer PDF .
Service conversations
Service conversations are now free. This change does not affect how service conversations are opened.
A service conversation is opened when any message other than a template message is delivered to your customer and no open conversation of any category exists between you and the customer.
Note that a customer service window must exist between you and the customer before you can send them a non-template message.
For example:
Hour 0: You send a targeted promotion (marketing template) to a customer. No open marketing conversation exists between you and the customer, so a marketing conversation lasting 24 hours is opened.
Hour 4: The customer messages you. This opens a customer service window between you and the customer, allowing you to send them any type of message for the next 24 hours.
Hour 5: You send an interactive list message to the customer. An open conversation already exists between you and the customer (a marketing conversation in this case), so a service conversation is not opened.
Hour 24: The marketing conversation expires.
Hour 25: The 24-hour customer service window is still open, so you send a second text message to the customer. No open conversation exists between you and the customer anymore, so a service conversation is opened, lasting 24 hours.
Hour 26: The 24-hour customer service window is still open, so you send a third text message to the customer. An open service conversation already exists between you and the customer, so a new service conversation is not opened.
For additional examples, see our pricing explainer PDF .
Customer Service Windows
See Customer Service Windows.
Conversation duration
Marketing, utility, authentication, and service conversations last 24 hours unless closed by a newly opened free-entry point conversation.
Free-entry point conversations last 72 hours.
Multiple conversations
It is possible to have multiple open conversations between you and a customer. This can happen in the following situations:
An open marketing, utility, or authentication conversation exists between you and a customer and you send them a template message of a different category within 24 hours.
An open service conversation exists between you and a customer and you send them a template message within 24 hours.
Free Tier conversations
As of November 1, 2024, you can open an unlimited number of service conversations at no charge. See Free Service Conversations to learn more.
Free Entry Point conversations
A free entry point conversation is opened if (1) a customer using a device running Android or iOS (the desktop and web clients are not supported) messages you via a Click to WhatsApp Ad or Facebook Page Call-to-Action button and (2) you respond within 24 hours. If you do not respond within 24 hours, a free entry point conversation is not opened and you must use a template to message the customer, which opens a marketing, utility, or authentication conversation, per the category of the template.
The free entry point conversation is opened as soon as your message is delivered and lasts 72 hours. When a free entry point conversation is opened, it automatically closes all other open conversations between you and the customer, and no new conversations will be opened until the free entry point conversation expires.
Once the free entry point conversation is opened, you can send any type of message to the customer without incurring additional charges. However, you can only send non-templates messages if there is an open customer service window between you and the customer.
For example, if the customer messages you via a Click to WhatsApp Ad at 10am and you respond via a template message at 10pm the same day:
The free entry point conversation starts at 10pm and lasts 72 hours.
You can send template messages at no charge in those 72 hours.
You can send non-template messages until 10am the next day, at which point the customer service window closes, as it is independent of the free entry point conversation (if the customer messages you again, however, it opens another 24-hour customer service window in which you can send any type of message).
