Messaging Limits
Updated: Nov 26, 2025
The messaging_limit_tier field, which used to return a business phone number’s messaging limit, has been deprecated. Request the whatsapp_business_manager_messaging_limit field instead.
This document describes messaging limits for the WhatsApp Business Platform.
Messaging limits are the maximum number of unique WhatsApp user phone numbers your business can deliver messages to, outside of a customer service window, within a moving 24-hour period.
Messaging limits are calculated and set at the business portfolio level and are shared by all business phone numbers within a portfolio. This means that if a business portfolio has multiple business phone numbers, it’s possible for one number to consume all of the portfolio’s messaging capability within a given period.
Newly created business portfolios have a messaging limit of 250, but this limit can be increased to:
2,000 (by completing a scaling path)
10,000 (via automatic scaling)
100,000 (via automatic scaling)
Unlimited (via automatic scaling)
Increasing your limit
You can increase your messaging limit to 2,000 by completing one of the scaling paths below. After that, we will automatically increase your limit to the next higher limit if you meet our automatic scaling criteria.
Scaling paths
Verify your business
Have your solution provider verify your business (if you were onboarded by one)
Send 2,000 delivered messages outside of customer service windows to unique WhatsApp user phone numbers within a 30-day moving period, using templates with a high quality rating.
Once you complete one of these paths, we will analyze your message quality. Based on this analysis, your number’s eligibility for automatic scaling will either be approved or denied.
Approvals
If your request is approved, we will immediately increase your business phone number’s messaging limit to 2,000 and notify you by email and developer alert. In addition, a business_capability_update webhook will be triggered with max_daily_conversations_per_business (for webhooks v24.0 and newer) and max_daily_conversation_per_phone (for v23.0 and older, until February, 2026) set to the new limit.
Additional messaging limit increases for your number can now happen automatically, via automatic scaling.
Denials
If your request is denied, we will maintain your business phone number’s messaging limit at its current level and notify you via email and developer alert. In addition, an account_alerts webhook will be triggered, with the alert_type and alert_description properties indicating alternate methods you can pursue to increase your limit.

Automatic scaling
Once your business portfolio’s messaging limit has been increased to 2,000, we will determine if it should be increased further according to the following criteria:
You are sending high-quality messages across all of your business phone numbers and templates
In the last 7 days, your business has utilized at least half of your current messaging limit
If these criteria are met, we will increase your portfolio’s limit by one level within 6 hours.
